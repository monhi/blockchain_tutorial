# Blockchain Tutorial
Every week, I try to read some essays and articles about blockchain technologies and programming skills. 
Keeping a track of those articles is something that I always handle with MS word documents.
But now I thinks it is good idea to share it as a Github repository. 
In this way other blockchain enthusiasts can also use it. 

**Ethereum Blockchain App using Ganache | Truffle | Solidity | Web3.js**
<a href="https://medium.com/@vshwsnahar3/ethereum-blockchain-app-using-ganache-truffle-solidity-web3-js-40dfc5369c91">Link</a>
A nice tutorial to show how to use following tools and technologies:
* Solidity language
* Ganache simulator
* Truffle development framework
* Web3.js JavaScript library
It also shows how to install Metamask extension to chrome web browser.
Metamask is an extension that we can add it to web browsers to handle communication with Ethereum networks ( both Mainnet and simulators).

In these 2 articles,  The writer tries to pinpoint the differences between  JavaScript and Solidity languages. 

One of the good aspects of these articles is that it shows some  interactions between  web3.js and Ethers.js libraries with solidity contracts.
